# Predicting_sleep_in_mammals
# DSTI
DSTI Project n°3 
Machine Learning with Python Project : Sleeping is a common activity for all the mammals. But there are huge discrepancies in the characteristics of their sleep. For example, some mammals sleep 10% of their day, others sleep 80% of their day. Does a large mammal have a better sleep than a small mammal? Who has the longer dreams?


The subject was suggested by Christophe Bécavin, Director of Indian-French Master of Computational Biology (IFMCB)
